# Paperwork

A documentation project by Enea Rossi / Adoratorio© Studio

Paperwork is a public archive of how we think, organize, and evolve as a studio.

## Structure

- `start-here/` — that’s where paperwork** begins.    
- `inside-notes/` — reflections and internal conversations  
- `creative-realities/` — how projects take shape  
- `design-prompts/` — questions to open up design space
