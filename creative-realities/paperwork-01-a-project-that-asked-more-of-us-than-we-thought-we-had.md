# Paperwork #01 – A project that asked more of us than we thought we had.

A behind-the-scenes look at one of Adoratorio’s most challenging projects of 2024, where process, direction and collaboration shaped more than just the final result.

*The first chapter in Creative Realities, a series that doesn’t show what we made with Adoratorio® Studio, but what we went through to make it.*

A project that was hard to hold together. Not because of how it had to be done. But because of how it had to be understood.

We started working on The Blue Desert in 2024, and it launched in early 2025. At first, everything seemed in place. We had the idea, the tools, the right people. It felt like one of those projects where, if you do your part well, things just align.

But it didn’t go that way.

</br>

Very quickly, we realized that everyone was working inside the same perimeter but not on the same thing. Design was moving in one direction, 3D in another, development was trying to bridge the two. 

**We were all working on the same project. But not the same version of it.**

It wasn’t about lack of clarity or commitment. It was about how we each imagined the tone, the gestures, the timing. And that difference, subtle at first, started to widen.

At some point, it became clear: we weren’t building a site. We were shaping a mood. And doing that together, without losing consistency, was more complicated than we thought.

</br>
</br>

## Coordinating doesn’t mean understanding

At the start, we moved in parallel. Design was waiting for 3D. Dev was waiting for design. 3D wasn’t waiting for anyone.

Then we switched to working all at once and it got worse.

Each decision from one team would shift something for the others. We kept adjusting. Every time we thought things were lining up, something small would break the balance again.

Meanwhile, we were talking with the client. There was trust, and curiosity. But that also meant we couldn’t fake it, we had to make real decisions, not just show polished pieces. And that’s hard to do when you’re not fully aligned inside.

We eventually understood that this wasn’t a linear process. We couldn’t treat it like one. We had to make space for discovery while still moving forward.

The challenges were both technical and relational. There were architectural decisions to make, performance issues to solve, and visual layers that didn’t always play well together. But what made it hard wasn’t just the complexity, it was learning how to move forward without always being aligned. Knowing when to step in, when to listen, when to adjust. That’s what held the project together.

## Code as part of the form

Development wasn’t something that came at the end. It shaped the project from within.

The complexity here wasn’t about writing difficult code, it was about deciding what needed to be code in the first place. Some things looked like animation, but had to be done with shaders. Some elements were purely visual, but had heavy performance impact. There were places where design had to adapt to how things moved, not the other way around.

Scene by scene, we had to decide how to keep the experience coherent. And it wasn’t obvious.

The result is smooth, almost minimal. But behind that, there were dozens of trade-offs, moments where we had to say no, simplify, rework. The real work wasn’t making it work. It was keeping it consistent.

## The gesture that made sense

One of the turning points came when Ale started painting on 3D textures by hand.

It wasn’t in the plan. But it worked.

That human gesture brought something we hadn’t found with digital tools, a kind of texture that felt intuitive, a bit raw, slightly imperfect. But then came the challenge: how do you keep visual coherence when what you’re using is, by nature, inconsistent?

Each surface required small corrections. It was less efficient, but it gave us control where we needed it. Harmony didn’t come from templates. It came from judgement. From slowing down and looking at each piece individually.

That same logic came back later, in the sound design.

</br>
</br>

## AI in the room, not at the table

We wanted the voiceover to feel like part of the environment, not a performance, not too perfect, just present.

So we used AI. Not to generate something final, but to explore directions quickly: tone, rhythm, language, variation. It opened up possibilities, but it also showed us what we didn’t want. Eventually we landed on something close to what we’d imagined at the start. But we wouldn’t have gotten there as fast without that process.

The AI didn’t replace anything. It extended our range for a bit, and then we went back to doing the thing by hand.

</br>

## From the studio. From me.

I didn’t lead this project the way I usually do. I wanted to see what would happen if the direction came from the team, not from one person. I believed in their ability to carry it through.

And they did — but not without difficulty.

This project tested how we collaborate. Not just how we design or develop, but how we align, make decisions, stay in sync.

It forced us to have harder conversations. It exposed a few things we needed to fix. But it also gave us new ways of working that stayed with us after the project ended.

**We were already trying to evolve as a studio. This just sped it up.**

The Blue Desert has been our most complex project so far. Not just in scale, but in how many things had to work together and stay consistent. It challenged how we collaborate, and in doing so, it changed how we work.
