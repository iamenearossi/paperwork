# Paperwork #03 – (Un)finished Loops, (Un)finished Thoughts

What if the real prompt isn’t what you write but how it changes you in return? A story about tools, teams, and the subtle loops that shape us.

## A Space for what doesn’t yet exist

At Adoratorio® Studio, we dedicate a significant part of our time to research and development. To progress, to experiment, to understand. Not just to keep up, but to go deeper. To explore how tools, methods, and perspectives can stretch the way we think and design.

A couple of years ago, one of those explorations became a project called Dying Life. It started as an experiment: we worked with Midjourney to generate and refine hundreds of pixelated flowers, then asked AI to restore each image as if every pixel were a small, living cell. Except that at every step, we removed something: one missing pixel, one small death, and observed what the machine would do with it.

But AI doesn’t understand death. It sees absence as an error. So it kept filling the gaps. Every time a pixel vanished, the system tried to regenerate it. Not with memory. Not with mourning. But by borrowing another fragment from another flower. The result was a blooming loop of patches and guesses, endlessly trying to fix what it could never truly comprehend.

That’s when I started thinking: maybe this is exactly what we do, or what we try to avoid doing, when we design. **We’re constantly choosing what to preserve, what to discard, and how much we’re willing to be changed in the process.**

</br>

That loop we witnessed in the machine, endlessly trying to fill in the gaps without really knowing what was gone, stayed with me. Maybe because it mirrored something I see and feel every day.

A few days ago, someone on the team told me they felt exhausted after two days of prompting and dialoguing with AI. Not overwhelmed, just mentally tired, as if their thoughts had been stretched and twisted in constant negotiation with something that doesn’t pause, doesn’t forget, and never truly understands.

It made me smile. Because that’s what I do most of the time. Not just with tools, but with people. Trying to guide them. Trying to understand what they’re trying to say, even when they can’t quite name it. Trying to hold space for something to unfold. Directing the project, and the person, toward what they could become.

And in the meantime, I change too. Because we don’t just build websites, brands or installations. **We build the conditions for meaning to emerge. For connection to take shape.** And those conditions are never neutral. They reach into us, ask something of us, and leave us slightly different than we were before.

</br>

## Tools are not neutral, either

The tools we use amplify this. Each one comes with a language, a frame, a speed. They shape how we see, what we consider a solution, what feels enough. They don’t just help us do things, they influence how we do them, and even what we decide to notice.

Some, like Midjourney, teach us to describe better, but also push us to expect too much, too fast. Some help us think in components, like Figma. Others convince us that everything can be structured, like Notion. Then there are those that stretch our imagination across space and time: Runway, Veo, TouchDesigner, Unity. They turn complexity into experience.

ChatGPT and Copilot whisper while we write, suggest before we ask, anticipate before we even realise there’s something to decide. Slack keeps us connected, but also never quite alone. Read.ai distills our conversations into bullet points, shrinking hours into a few lines.

Even the internal agents we’ve trained for analysis, strategy and business are not just extensions. **They’re reflections. The more we use them, the more we become the kind of studio that uses them.** Each of them, like a colleague, like a mirror, leaves something behind: a habit, a language, a bias, a speed. They stretch our skills, but they also bend our perception. And if we’re not paying attention, they begin making decisions before we even notice there was one to make.

</br>

## The real prompt is not on the screen

Sometimes, I wonder if designing is really about creating something  or if it’s more about listening. About staying with the discomfort of not knowing, long enough for something meaningful to emerge.

Because even when we use the same tools, no two designers use them the same way. The choices we make, what to keep, what to remove, what to surrender to automation, reveal something about us. About what we value. About how we see the world.

And that’s the real prompt. Not the sentence we write in Midjourney, or the block we move in Figma. **But the one we live with, as a question. As a tension. As a practice.**

We’re not just feeding them data. We’re feeding them assumptions, aesthetics, expectations. And in return, they train us. They streamline our process, yes. But they also steer it. Toward what’s probable. What’s available. What’s easy.

Which means: if we don’t stop to reflect, if we don’t resist a little, we risk designing from inertia rather than intention.

That’s why in our studio, we don’t see tools as solutions. We see them as questions. Each one asking: **What kind of work do you want to do? What kind of designer do you want to be?**

</br>

## We shape the work. The work shapes us.

At Adoratorio, we work across strategy, branding, web experiences and installations. We design systems, but we’re also part of them. Every project pulls something different from us. Every challenge rewires a part of how we work, how we communicate, how we imagine what’s next.

And in that loop of building and being built, **we’ve become more precise. More porous. Less attached to control, more invested in clarity.**

We’ve learned to put extra effort where it matters. To show the idea as if it were already real, because that’s how belief starts. To treat design not as what comes after strategy, but as the moment where strategy becomes visible. Most of all, we’ve learned to listen to ourselves, to our team, to the silence between iterations.

Maybe that’s the real loop. **The truth is, the work changes us.** Each project rewires us a little. Each tool reflects something back. Each person in the team pushes the others forward. We shape the work. The work shapes us. Again and again.

And maybe, somewhere in that loop, something true remains.And you?
**What stays with you?**

Thanks for being here.</br>
Let’s see where this goes.
