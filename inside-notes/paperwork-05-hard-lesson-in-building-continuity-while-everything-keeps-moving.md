# Paperwork #05 – Hard lesson in building continuity while everything keeps moving.

*A reflection on losing symmetry, building structures, and learning that continuity is something you actively take care of.*

<pre>
<b>Morning log – Not long ago</b>

10:47 – Someone asks a question in Slack.
14:23 – Same question, different channel.
16:11 – Call ends. Decision made. No one writes it down.
Next day – “Wait, what did we decide?”

<i>This happened three times. In one week.</i>

## Symmetry was doing the work

For a long time, the studio worked because we didn’t have to think about continuity.

Before Covid, everyone was in the studio. During Covid, everyone was remote. In both moments, the work held up. Not because one setup was better than the other, but because the field was symmetrical. Frictions were shared, the rhythm was common, decisions moved in the same way for everyone. We were very good in those conditions.

After Covid, many of us wanted to return to the studio. We opened a new space. There was a real desire to be together again, to rebuild proximity, to feel the work happening in the same place. That intention was genuine.

But in the meantime, something else had changed.

People had changed. Lives and priorities had shifted. Over time, I realised that I had changed too. Not in who I was, but in how the studio now asked for presence and responsibility. Things that used to flow on their own started requiring more care. Roles I had been holding implicitly could no longer pass through a single person without becoming fragile.

It was no longer just about good work. What we started negotiating was whether the work could coexist with personal life, with different rhythms, with different needs.

Some people came back to the studio full time. Some started working remotely two days a week. Others moved to different cities, or different countries. Gradually, the studio adapted to that. The symmetry that had held everything together was no longer there.

The studio didn’t change through a single decision. It stretched over time. The work started happening across different places and schedules, with different degrees of presence. Nothing broke, but the conditions stopped being shared. **We were no longer all in the same place, and we were no longer all remote. We were mixed, and that changed how the work started to take shape.**

At first, the change felt manageable. Almost unnoticeable. Then its effects started to surface.



</br>

## Presence becomes uneven

When you don’t see someone regularly, your brain tends to register them as less present. Not intentionally, but automatically. Even when you know they’re there, working, contributing, carrying responsibility, the lack of visibility changes how decisions form and how attention is distributed.

I started noticing this in small ways first. A question asked twice in different channels. A file updated in three different versions. A decision made in a call, then revisited two days later because someone wasn’t there and needed context.

None of this was dramatic. But it accumulated.

Projects began carrying more than their immediate scope. Decisions made in one context resurfaced in another. Questions that once resolved themselves quickly started needing to be revisited. Not because projects were more complex, but because the people and the decisions around them were no longer contained in the same space.

**Work didn’t reset anymore. It accumulated.**

Context started repeating itself without us noticing. The same question surfaced in Slack, then again in a call, then a third time in a doc update. Not because we weren’t paying attention, but because there was no longer a single place where things naturally landed. Files reflected individual paths rather than shared ones. Not out of carelessness, but because many of the small rituals we used to rely on (coffee breaks, desk check-ins, overheard conversations) no longer had a natural place to happen.

This is when organization became visible. Not as a goal, but as a signal.



</br>

## Background moves to the foreground

When the studio was symmetrical, organization stayed in the background. It lived in proximity, in habits, in the things we didn’t have to say out loud. Presence was doing more work than we realised.

As presence became uneven, organization moved to the foreground. Not because we needed more control, but because things that once held themselves together started drifting.

The first reaction was to adjust: add structure, make things clearer, document more. We introduced new rituals. Weekly syncs. Shared project boards. A single source of truth for files. Better handoff templates.

Some of this helped. Some of it just added weight.

The real shift wasn’t about finding the right tool or the right process. It was understanding that **organization isn’t something you design once. It changes when people change.** When roles shift, when lives rearrange, when different rhythms enter the studio, the old structures don’t break, they just stop fitting.

At that point, organization stops being about efficiency and starts being about responsibility.

Responsibility for what carries over.
For what doesn’t disappear when a project ends.
For what keeps shaping the work even when no one is actively looking at it.

## Building places for memory

Some are working. Some are still being tested. Everything moved to Notion: a dashboard system that handles daily work (projects, tasks) but also what happens behind the scenes (CRM, finance, marketing). Everything lives in one place now.

Slack got reorganized with a more granular channel structure. Slack Canvas now holds project overviews: brief, timeline, milestones, delivery, team, notes. Context doesn’t evaporate when a call ends because it’s already documented there.

AI agents handle meeting notes and summaries, so decisions get captured even when attention is split.

Lesson learned meetings are built into the process, both internally and with clients, at the end of every project. Not retrospectives. Structured moments to name what worked, what didn’t, and what stays.

Weekly lead meetings coordinate teams and projects. Board and business syncs align strategy. Studio-wide sharing sessions happen where everyone (remote or not) shows up. Not to present work, but to stay connected to what’s moving and why.

None of this solved everything. But it gave us something different: **places where things can stay long enough to matter.**

Because that’s what continuity really is. Not a system. Not a rule. But a shared space where context doesn’t have to be rebuilt from scratch every time.

</br>

## Taking care, not taking over

Presence, shared information, and continuity can no longer sit in the background. They have to come first. Otherwise, the work slowly loses coherence (not in big, visible ways, but in a thousand small frictions that add up over time).

This isn’t about nostalgia for how things used to be. It’s about understanding that **the studio is no longer the same shape it was three years ago.** And that’s okay. But it means the work of holding it together looks different now.

Some of this work doesn’t need more thinking. It needs space, and rituals, and the willingness to keep adjusting even when it feels like you’ve already adjusted enough.

And that’s where the studio is now. Still changing, still adjusting, but more aware that **continuity is not something you inherit. It’s something you actively take care of.**
