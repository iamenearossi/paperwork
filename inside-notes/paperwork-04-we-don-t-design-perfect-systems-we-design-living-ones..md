# Paperwork #04 – We don’t design perfect systems. We design living ones.

*An exploration of what remains after functionality is solved and why presence is the only thing that makes digital work human.*

</br>

In early September, Robert Thiemann *[(Betterness)](https://betterness.space/)* and  Huawei invited us to give a talk for the *[Huawei Aesthetic Research Center]* (https://www.linkedin.com/company/huawei-italy-research-centers/) in Milan. I didn’t imagine it would become a moment of alignment. 

What started as a stage presentation slowly turned into a synthesis of questions we had been carrying for years. Camilla, the other co-founder of Adoratorio, and I shaped it together, with Filippo’s support as well, until she got sick and I had to step on stage alone. In a way, that made it even more personal: standing there, I wasn’t just showing projects, **but retracing the reasons why Adoratorio was born in the first place.*

## When a screen became a place

Back in 2013, skeuomorphism was disappearing, flat design was becoming dominant, and the word “experience” had not yet taken over our industry. In that climate, Adoratorio didn’t come out of a business plan but from an intuition: **a screen could be more than an interface. It could become a place for emotional connection.** While the industry was focused on speed, funnels, and efficiency, we felt the real challenge was elsewhere. Not to design faster or leaner, but to design more human.

More than a decade later, that intuition still feels urgent. Technology has advanced to a point where capability is not the problem anymore. We can build almost anything. 

**The real question is: what do we choose to build? And why?**

</br>

## Presence is fragile

That question keeps bringing me back to presence. Presence is what makes an experience linger after the interaction ends. **And presence is fragile.** It only appears in certain conditions. Sometimes it comes from materiality: the tactility of a surface, the density of a shadow, the slowness of a transition. We saw this in *[Ferragamo Enigma](https://adoratorio.studio/ferragamo)*, where the mechanics of a puzzle campaign kept people engaged, but what made them stay was the hand-drawn lines, the muted rhythm, the sense of texture that felt almost physical. **Tactility doesn’t speed things up, but it makes people linger. And lingering is where meaning happens.**

</br>

## Beauty is the logic, not the surface

Presence also comes from beauty, but not the kind reduced to decoration. **Beauty as structure is the connective logic that holds things together across formats that have nothing in common.** Our work with Gucci showed this in many forms: *[playful micro-games](https://adoratorio.studio/gucci-games)*, the *[Osteria’s digital atmosphere](https://adoratorio.studio/gucci-osteria)*, *[VR labyrinths](https://adoratorio.studio/gucci-time-maze)* that felt like parallel worlds. Each project looked different, yet they carried the same coherence because beauty was not a surface treatment. **It was the architecture beneath.** When beauty is decorative, it entertains. **When beauty is structural, it builds culture.**

</br>

## Predictability kills memory

Surprise is another way presence reveals itself. In a world of infinite scroll, **predictability is the fastest way to be forgotten.** The flicker of something unexpected, a sudden pause or a playful disruption, can transform an interaction into memory. *[Pasqua Wines](https://adoratorio.studio/pasqua-wines)* was a reminder of this: a digital villa that looked credible at first glance but revealed strange interruptions, from slowed transitions to shifting rhythms, even a wandering tiger. Those gestures made people stop, look twice, and remember. **Surprise is not a gimmick. It is a strategy for memory.**

</br>

## AI imitates. Empathy defines.

And then there is empathy. Generative systems can now create endless variations, but without boundaries variation dissolves into noise. **AI can reproduce aesthetics, but not intention.** It can simulate life, but not comprehend loss, fragility, or desire. In *[Dying Life](https://adoratorio.studio/project/dying-life)*, which I had already written about in *[Paperwork #03](https://github.com/iamenearossi/paperwork/blob/main/design-prompts/paperwork-03-unfinished-loops-unfinished-thoughts.md)*, we asked AI to reconstruct flowers as they decayed. The results were flawless but hollow, a surface imitation of death with none of its gravity. That absence revealed something essential: **our advantage is not productivity but empathy**, the ability to design with presence, resonance, and cultural intention.

</br>

## Designing living systems

All of these threads, from materiality to beauty, from surprise to empathy, point to the same ambition: **designing for presence.** The projects that stay with us are never the most efficient or the most optimized. **They are the ones that feel alive, intentional, and sensitive.** At Adoratorio we call this the Branded Moment, that instant when something unexpected happens and what remains is not what you saw, but how you felt.

</br>
</br>

That is the lesson I carried back from the Huawei stage.</br>
**We don’t believe in designing perfect systems. We believe in designing living ones.** Because presence is not about adding more. **It is about daring to create the conditions for beauty, empathy, and poetry to appear, even for a second.**
