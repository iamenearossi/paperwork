## Creative work is shifting

Over the past few months, I’ve been hearing a lot of conversations about how creative work is shifting. Some are new. Others echo things we’ve felt for a while. But they all point in the same direction: **away from traditional agency models and toward something more flexible, more integrated, more human.** One article on *Entrepreneur* – [“How Creativity Died - and What’s Rising in Its Place”](https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-creativity-died-and-whats-rising-in-its-place/487245) – talked about the end of traditional agencies, and the rise of smaller, more integrated teams. Claudio Guglieri’s talk at **Awwwards** Valencia 2024 ([Link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjZrlzRkKv8&ab_channel=awwwards.)) touched similar points: small teams work better than big ones. Fewer layers, no hand-offs. Just people who know how to talk to each other and stay present.

None of this felt surprising. If anything, I recognized what we’ve been experiencing for a while. Not because we were ahead of anything, but because the shifts didn’t arrive all at once. **They accumulated, decision after decision.** Some were intentional. Others emerged from friction, or from moments when the usual ways of doing things stopped making sense. **There wasn’t a manifesto. Just the feeling that certain structures were no longer helpful.** And that if we wanted to stay focused on what really mattered, we had to keep adjusting, even if it meant moving slower, or in less obvious directions.

At Adoratorio, **we’ve never operated like a traditional agency.** We didn’t build a structure that requires constant growth just to stay alive, and we don’t see value in producing more just because we can. It’s not a positioning choice. **It’s how we’ve learned to work.** Our studio is made up of experienced people, each with a deep understanding of their field, but also with the ability to look beyond it. We’ve chosen to stay shaped as a studio, not to seem niche, but to stay close to the work, to each other, to the people we collaborate with. **That closeness is what allows us to build with continuity, presence, a shared sense of ownership. It’s not about control, but something more subtle, a very specific kind of care.**

Many of our projects grow in close relationship with internal brand teams. Not just designers and brand managers, but also developers, creative strategists, the people who shape physical experiences, store environments, campaigns, events, immersive formats. Sometimes we’re there from day one. Sometimes we join mid-process. Sometimes we become part of a longer internal journey. **What matters is not when we enter, but how. And how we choose to listen.** We don’t start with fixed answers. We try to understand the real context, what’s already in motion, what’s missing, what’s fragile, what deserves protection. Then we help shape a direction that holds all those pieces together. A direction that isn’t just approved, but understood, shared, carried forward.

That kind of process doesn’t scale easily. **It requires attention, presence, time.** It doesn’t follow templates. It depends on the people involved, the rhythm of the project, the conversations that happen in-between. It depends on trust, and on the ability to read what isn’t said. **And most of all, it depends on being okay with ambiguity, especially in the early stages.** We’ve learned that trying to control everything too early often blocks the best things from happening. So we start differently. Not by declaring what we’ll do, but by making space for what the project could become.

It’s not a playbook. It’s a posture. A way of working that holds space for change and tries to give it form, without forcing it.

## Led by design

There’s no formula. Sometimes we lead. Sometimes we support. Sometimes we step back. It depends on what’s needed and on what the project, or the people, are really asking for. That kind of sensitivity takes time. It’s more complex. But that’s where the real work happens. Where the unspoken starts to take shape. Where alignment doesn’t come from a deck, but from presence.

We didn’t invent this approach. We just stayed close to it. Close enough to realize that **process is not about control, it’s about clarity.** And clarity doesn’t always come from knowing where you’re going. It often comes from knowing how you want to walk there. Together.

One of the reasons we work this way is simple: **Adoratorio is led by people who come from design.** That doesn’t mean we’re just creatively involved. It means we’re responsible for the direction, the coherence, the way things hold together. We don’t sit apart from the process. We’re inside it. Listening. Sketching. Making decisions that are aesthetic, strategic, and human, all at once.

That changes how things feel. Because the leadership isn’t external to the work. It’s embedded in it. It means you don’t need to convince someone “above” to care about details. The details already matter to everyone. That’s what keeps the bar high, and the loop short. Not hierarchy but shared standards.

I came across a quote by Roos Chant a while ago:

> “A creative agency not run by a creative leader is just an accounting firm with a lot of people wearing black T-shirts.”

It stayed with us. Still does.  
(And yes, we wear black T-shirts. But only because they look good.)

</br>

This isn’t about declaring a position.  
It’s just a way of working that’s shaped who we are.  
And maybe now it’s worth sharing.

Thanks for being here.</br>
Let’s see where this goes.
