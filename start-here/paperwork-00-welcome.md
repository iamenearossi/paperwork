# Paperwork #00 – Welcome
*A founder’s way of making sense of what doesn’t get seen.*

Some things don’t end up in a portfolio.  
But they hold everything together.

That’s where **Paperwork** begins.  
A persoanl project born from the need to slow down, observe, and share what usually stays in the background.

I’m Enea Rossi — CEO/ Co-Founder and Creative Partner at Adoratorio® Studio.  
And over time, I’ve realized that some of the most important things we do  
aren’t things we show. They’re choices, tensions, patterns.  
They’re *how we work*.

**Paperwork** where I write those things down.
It’s a space for documenting thoughts, questions, and choices. Not as a showcase, but as a form of clarity.

This space lives in two places:

This space lives in two places:  
**On Substack**, for reading.  
**On GitHub**, as a growing archive.

It’s not a blog.  
It’s not a newsletter.  
It’s a way to make sense of how we work, and why.

### Three formats:

**Inside Notes**  
Observations from the studio.  
Personal thoughts, shared moments, and team voices (*Shared Thoughts*).

**Creative Realities**  
Stories behind the work.  
Not what we made — but what shaped it.

**Design Prompts**  
Open questions, quiet sparks.  
The kind that move things forward (or make us pause).

> <i>Not to explain it, but to keep it alive.</i>

Thanks for being here.</br>
Let’s see where this goes.
